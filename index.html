    	<h3>In 2+ sentences, describe who you are and what you do</h3>
    	<p class="questions"> I'm currently studying to obtain my master's degree in Information Management
    	Systems from the Harvard Extension School. I have a Bachelor's degree in the same
    	subject from California State University, Northridge. I have been interested in
    	technology from a very young age and I currently work in the IT department of a 
    	national movie theater chain. I am also currently in the California Air National Guard 
    	as a Senior Airman. This allows me to get some great experience and helps me pay
    	for my education.</p>

    	<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
    	<p class="questions">I'm taking this course because I have a fairly good grasp of HTML and CSS as well as
    	some other web programming languages, but I'd like to learn in a more formal setting and
    	hopefully improve my skills as well along the way!</p>

    	<h3>What previous experiencve do you have with programming?</h3>
    	<p class="questions">I have previous experience with web programming through PHP, javascript, and some
    	scrupting with python. I have experience in application programming with C, python,
    	java, and perl. My experience is a combination of self-taught and instruction through school.</p>

    	<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
    	<p class="questions">For this class I am working on a Mac, since it is actually easier to work through git from a good
    	command line, rather than fiddle with getting it to work on windows!</p>
    
   	<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
    	<p class="questions">I am excited to learn as much as I can from this class!</p>

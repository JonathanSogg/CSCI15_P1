    <h1>In 2+ sentences, describe who you are and what you do</h1>
    <p> I'm currently studying to obtain my master's degree in Information Management
    Systems from the Harvard Extension School. I have a Bachelor's degree in the same
    subject from California State University, Northridge. I have been interested in
    technology from a very young age and I currently work in the IT department of a 
    national movie theater chain. I am also currently in the California Air National Guard 
    as a Senior Airman. This allows me to get some great experience and helps me pay
    for my education.</p>

    <h1>Why are you taking this course?</h1>
    <p>I'm taking this course because I have a fairly good grasp of HTML and CSS as well as
    some other web programming languages, but I'd like to learn in a more formal setting and
    hopefully improve my skills as well along the way!</p>

    <h1>What previous experiencve do you have with programming?</h1>

    <h1>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h1>

    <h1>Anything else we should know?</h1>
